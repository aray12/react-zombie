Skeleton React application with authentication and async actions

Authentication is something that every application requires. Even if you don't plan on charging for your service or requiring a login for any of your pages, allowing users to persist settings and other forms of user data is expected. This is a very basic example of a React app that provides authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
